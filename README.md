# python-guessing-game
This is a basic number guessing game.

The computer randomly generates a number between 1 and 100 inclusive and the player tries to guess it in the fewest attempts as possible. The computer replies with either "Lower..", "Higher..", or "You guessed it!" with the number of tries it took.
Once the player guesses there is an option to continue the game or exit.
